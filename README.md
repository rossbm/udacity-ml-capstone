udacity-ML-capstone
==============================

This github repo contains my final project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. It contains my final report and all the necessary code to reporduce my results.

Setup Instructions
-------------
To download, please use the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/wertu234/udacity-ml-capstone
```

This will download the repo to the current directory. To ensure that you have the necessary packages, please use the Anaconda distribution of Python. With Anaconda, you will have access to the conda environment manager. In the newly created folder, type:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a new environment named _capstone_. Please note that it will download a bunch of packages. To activate the environment:
*  Windows: ```activate capstone_env```
*  macOs and Linux: ```source activate capstone_env```

After this has been completed, you can activate Jupyter Notebook by typing ```jupyter notebook``` into your shell. You can then explore the notebooks. The notebooks are ordered and should be run in sequence, more or less. If you run a later notebook without having run an earlier one, it is possible that an exception will be raised since some notebooks rely on the outputs of previous notebooks.
